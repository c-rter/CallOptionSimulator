This simulator is designed to assist in learning call options.

Generate custom charts to see how a call option's premium changes over various scenarios and parameters.

Charts are generated based on normal distribution and options priced with the Black-Scholes-Merton model.

## üìà About Chart Generation

The simulation (tools/simGraph.js) generates a normal distribution
of price movement relative to the volatility input. Daily SD (standard deviation) is calculated, then an
RNG roll is conducted for a percentage of the daily SD. A multiplier is applied to the daily SD based on another RNG roll
for a normal distribution of "types" of movement days (enabling days where movement surpasses the first deviation). 

Changes to the "Luck" parameter affects price movements that fall within the 1st deviation to be all positive
or all negative (68%). As this does not affect 2nd+ deviation movement days, a simulation with "good" luck still
has a slim chance of trending downward. Repeated simulation with selected luck influence should generate desired result.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Disclaimer

This model is for learning purposes only and is not intended to be financial advice.
Though it mimics the realistic movement of option prices, actual market prices will vary,
transaction fees will apply, and option prices will be further affected by changes in implied volatility
(this model uses consistent IV throughout projections).

<h1 align="left">About Call Options</h1>

## üìÉ What is a Call Option Contract?

A call option contract gives a purchaser the right to buy a set
amount of shares at a predetermined price. A standard stock option
contract covers 100 shares. It is important to note that
exercising the contract is a right, but not an obligation for the
call holder.

All call contracts have two main features, a strike price and an
expiration date.

## ‚ùå Strike Price

The strike price is the fixed price at which a contract can be
surpass the strike price in order for the contract to be worthy of
exercising. Otherwise, exercising the contract would mean
purchasing shares for more than you can buy them for on the open
market. For example, a contract could allow the purchaser to buy
100 shares at a strike price of $105. If the stock price moves to
$106, exercising the contract to buy at the lower strike price
would lead to a $1 profit on every share purchased.

## üïë Expiration Date

The expiration date dictates the amount of time the contract is
valid. The value of the option is dependent on the amount of days
to expiry. Day by day, the value of the option changes as the
contract approaches the expiry date. As longer dated options have
more time to reach their potential, more days to expiry increases
the price (premium) of the option.

American-style options can be exercised at any time prior to the
expiration. European-style options can only be exercised on the
expiration date.

Note: This simulator uses the Black-Scholes-Merton model for
pricing European options, but the fundamentals observed are still
relevant to those purchasing American derivatives.

## üí∞ Premium

The incentive for the option seller is the premium. The premium is
the total cost of the option. This includes both the current value
of exercising the option, if the strike price is below the current
stock price, and an estimate of future movement potential. In the
seller's ideal outcome, the stock price ends up below the strike
price, and they pocket the premium as the contract expires
worthless.

When a call option is ‚Äúout of the money‚Äù, the current stock price
is below the strike price. The contract cannot yet be exercised,
and in this case the value of the option (the premium) is only the
potential for it to move above the strike price.

When a call option is ‚Äúin the money‚Äù, the current stock price is
above the strike price. The contract is eligible to be exercised
(immediately or on expiration date depending on
American/European). The premium in this case factors in the amount
the stock has surpassed the strike price, and the potential for it
to move further.

## üßÆ Rates of Change

Where the stock price lies in relation to the strike price effects
the options value and rates of change.  

For example: $10 stock moves to $10.50 (Days to expiry: 30)

Strike 1: $11 -> Option premium moves from $5 to $7.50

Strike 2: $15 -> Option premium moves from $0.20 to $0.30

In the first option, the strike price is closer to the current
stock price. Because the probability and potential of the first
option being ‚Äúin the money‚Äù is higher than Option 2, it is priced
higher from the start.

The amount the option premium changes with a $0.50 increase in the
stock price is also larger ($2.50). The same movement in Option 2
only moves the option‚Äôs value $0.10, because it still has a long
way to go before it is ‚Äúin the money‚Äù. What you are noticing is a
difference in delta, one of the five option greeks that are used
to measure risk. More about the option greeks can be learned [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxmIvvROge4&ab_channel=TDAmeritrade)

## üè¶ Risk Free Interest Rate

The risk-free interest rate is a hypothetical rate of return
representing what an investor could expect to receive on an
investment with absolutely zero risk. Though no investments are
100% risk free in reality, safe securities such as U.S. treasury
bills or the LIBOR (London Inter-bank Offered Rate) can be used as
reliable benchmarks. As call options free up capital investment
opportunities for the call purchaser, higher interest rates will
create higher priced options.

## üí∏ Implied Volatility Percentage

Implied Volatility is a metric estimating the range of future
share price movement. IV is determined by measuring historical
price movement and factoring in current market sentiment.

The volatility percentage represents an estimate of one standard
deviation of the stock price over a period of one year. Standard
deviation is a statistics concept that measures the likelihood of
outcomes. In a normal distribution bell curve, 68% of outcomes are
estimated to fall within one standard deviation, 27% of outcomes
within two deviations, 4.5% within three deviations, and 0.2%.

This is best explained with a couple examples:

A $100 stock with a 50% IV is expected to have a 68% chance to
stay within $50 of the current stock price, meaning a potential
range of $50 - $150 over the year. There is a 27% chance estimated
that it surpasses $150 or falls below $50, and approximately 4.5%
chance it surpasses $200.

A high growth stock with a lot of market buzz could have an IV
percentage of 150%. If it was currently sitting at $100, this
indicates that the market sees potential for the company to more
than double in growth. A single deviation of this stock would be
$150, therefore there is an estimated 68% chance it stays within
the $0 - $250 range. Probability would further dictate a ceiling
of $400 for the second deviation (27%), and $550 for the third (0.2%).
